# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview and Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to find out the differences in rideshare data between people from various city types. The rideshare data was analyzed using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Regardless of the month, Urban areas clearly have significantly higher total fares than Suburban and Rural areas. Suburban areas are next, with total fares higher than Urban areas but lower than Rural areas. Lastly, Urban areas have the lowest total fare value. There appears to be very little difference between the total fare values from month to month. 

Interestingly, from Rural to Suburban to Urban areas, the average fare per ride and per driver decreased, while the total number of rides, drivers, and fare values increased. 

You can see the data values below.
