# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview and Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to find out the differences in rideshare data between people from various city types. The rideshare data was analyzed using Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## Results 

Here are the results we obtained from analyzing the data:

Regardless of the month, Urban areas clearly have significantly higher total fares than Suburban and Rural areas. Suburban areas are next, with total fares higher than Urban areas but lower than Rural areas. Lastly, Urban areas have the lowest total fare value. There appears to be very little difference between the total fare values from month to month. 

Interestingly, from Rural to Suburban to Urban areas, the average fare per ride and per driver decreased, while the total number of rides, drivers, and fare values increased. 

You can see the data values for Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver on the chart below.

## Summary

There are several moves that we can recommend to the CEO that can be taken to address disparities among the three city types: 

* There should be incentives for drivers to move from more populated areas (Urban) to less populated areas (Rural) so that the cost per ride will be lower for riders. 

* Drivers should be educated regarding the various fare differences by areas. If more drivers were aware that they could earn significantly more by driving in suburban areas rather than cities, they may be more likely to go to these areas and even out the disparities. 

* A marketing push to acquire more riders in cities could be helpful to meet with the demand and number of drivers located in Urban areas. This means that marketing funding may be best spent in cities where there are already many drivers looking to offer their services.
